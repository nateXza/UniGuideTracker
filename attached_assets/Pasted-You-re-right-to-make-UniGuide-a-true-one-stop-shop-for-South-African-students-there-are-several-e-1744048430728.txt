You're right - to make UniGuide a true one-stop shop for South African students, there are several enhancements we could implement. Here are my recommendations:

Add TVET Colleges Section
TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) colleges are an important alternative pathway for many South African students. Adding them would make the platform more comprehensive:

Create a dedicated TVET Colleges page similar to the Universities page
Include information about various qualifications, National Certificates, and diploma programs
Highlight the lower cost and practical skills focus compared to universities
Feature apprenticeship and employment pathways from TVET programs
Other Key Improvements
Career Integration and Job Market Data
Add real job market data showing employment rates and average salaries by field
Integrate with job portals to show current openings in different fields
Include success stories from graduates in various industries
Financial Planning Tools
Create a comprehensive funding calculator for different institutions
Add a NSFAS eligibility pre-checker tool
Include bursary matching functionality based on student profiles
Provide budget planning tools for student living expenses
Academic Bridging Information
Add resources for students who need to improve marks to qualify
Include information about foundation year programs
Feature online bridging courses and remedial options
Multi-Platform Access
Develop a mobile app for better accessibility
Create a low-data version for users with limited internet access
Implement SMS notification services for critical application deadlines
Community Features
Build student forums for peer advice and questions
Create a mentorship matching service with current university students
Add an alumni network for career guidance from professionals
Personalized Roadmaps
Implement a timeline feature showing all critical deadlines for a student's chosen path
Create a personalized checklist of documents needed for applications
Add reminder notifications for important application dates
Would you like me to implement any of these features? I'd recommend starting with the TVET Colleges section since this would immediately broaden the platform's usefulness to more South African students.
